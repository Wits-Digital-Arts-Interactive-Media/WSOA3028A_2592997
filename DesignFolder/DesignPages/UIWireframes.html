        My index page aims for simplicity, featuring just the title of my website and four hyperlinks leading to the
        main
        sections. Sometimes, I feel it strikes the right balance, offering a clean and focused entry point for
        visitors.
        Yet, there are moments of uncertainty where I wonder if it might be too minimalistic. Despite this, I find
        myself drawn to its straightforward approach and am inclined to stick with this design for now, appreciating
        its
        simplicity.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am still not sure how I feel about giving users the choice of what they look at. As odd as it may sound, I
        grapple with the notion of loading users into a website and immediately granting them the freedom to choose
        their path. There's a part of me that questions whether this approach might dilute the intended experience
        or lead to a disjointed journey. However, I also recognize the importance of user agency in shaping their
        interactions with the site and acknowledge its significant impact on overall user experience. Perhaps even
        offering a simple 'About Me' page as the initial landing point could streamline the user's experience while
        still providing a sense of autonomy. This is a concept I'm eager to explore further through playtesting and
        user feedback.

        The design for the blog index resonates with me for its simplicity and effectiveness. It's incredibly
        straightforward yet remarkably functional. The layout isn't overwhelming, making it easy for visitors to
        locate
        what they need. The top navigation bar facilitates seamless movement across the website, while the prominent
        "Weekly Blogs" title in the center draws attention to the latest posts. Beneath it, the neatly listed blog
        entries maintain clarity and organization, ensuring users can easily find the content they're looking for.

    <p>
        While experimenting with a more modern or "digital" aesthetic for this design iteration, I find myself torn
        between the allure of visual captivation and the comfort of familiarity. Although visually captivating, I
        find
        myself gravitating back towards the simplicity of the first design. There's an undeniable allure to the
        sleekness of this new approach, yet something about the familiarity of the original design resonates with
        me.

    <p>
        Inspired by the simplicity of the initial blog index design, I sought to replicate its effectiveness for the
        essays page. While I aimed to differentiate the two, upon reflection, I realize that consistency throughout
        the
        website could enhance the overall user experience. Perhaps incorporating similar elements from the blog
        index
        design would create a cohesive browsing experience across different sections of the website, enhancing user
        engagement and navigation.

    <p>
        My current portfolio page design appeals to me, but I have reservations about its future appearance once I
        start
        adding screenshots of my game. The potential for drastic contrasts between elements concerns me, as it may
        disrupt the overall aesthetic I've cultivated. Despite this uncertainty, I appreciate the overall design and
        layout of the page, finding it visually appealing and functional.

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">Goal Alignment</h2>
    The goal of the website design is to create a clean, minimalist aesthetic that focuses on user experience and easy
    navigation. By keeping a consistent layout with the name and navigation at the top across all pages, the design
    supports intuitive browsing and helps users quickly find what they need.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">Information Structure - Content Mapping</h2>
        The content on the website is organized into four main sections, each accessible via cards on the index page. This
        high-level structure provides a clear overview of the site's offerings. Within each section, a list of linked
        components with hover text descriptions gives users a preview of the content without overwhelming them with too much
        information upfront.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">User Flow - Screens, Behaviour, and Decisions</h2>
    The user flow starts on the index page, where they can click on one of the four cards to enter a specific section.
    Each section page follows a similar layout with a heading and list of linked components. When the user hovers over a
    component, the text changes to reveal more details about that page's content. Clicking on a component takes the user
    to the corresponding page.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">List and explanation of selected Interface Elements</h2>
    The key interface elements chosen for the website include:
    Navigation: A simple navigation bar at the top right allows users to easily move between pages. Keeping it
    consistent across the site enhances usability.
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>Cards: The four cards on the index page serve as entry points to the main sections. Their large size and placement
                make them visually prominent.</li>
                <li>Linked Components: The lists of linked components on each section page provide access to the site's content. Hover
                    effects add interactivity and give users a preview of the linked pages.</li>
                <li> Poppins Font: This clean, readable font contributes to the minimalist aesthetic and ensures content is easy to scan.
                    Minimal Text: By limiting text on pages and using hover effects for additional details, the design avoids clutter
                    and focuses the user's attention on the most important information.</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    </p>

    <p>
        These interface elements work together to create a user-friendly experience that is easy to navigate and visually
        appealing. The consistent layout and use of interactive elements like hover effects enhance engagement and help
        users find the content they need quickly.
