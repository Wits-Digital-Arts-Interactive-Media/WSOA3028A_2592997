            My index page aims for simplicity, featuring just the title of my website and four hyperlinks leading to the
            main
            sections. Sometimes, I feel it strikes the right balance, offering a clean and focused entry point for
            visitors.
            Yet, there are moments of uncertainty where I wonder if it might be too minimalistic. Despite this, I find
            myself drawn to its straightforward approach and am inclined to stick with this design for now, appreciating
            its
            simplicity.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am still not sure how I feel about giving users the choice of what they look at. As odd as it may sound, I
            grapple with the notion of loading users into a website and immediately granting them the freedom to choose
            their path. There's a part of me that questions whether this approach might dilute the intended experience
            or lead to a disjointed journey. However, I also recognize the importance of user agency in shaping their
            interactions with the site and acknowledge its significant impact on overall user experience. Perhaps even
            offering a simple 'About Me' page as the initial landing point could streamline the user's experience while
            still providing a sense of autonomy. This is a concept I'm eager to explore further through playtesting and
            user feedback.

            The design for the blog index resonates with me for its simplicity and effectiveness. It's incredibly
            straightforward yet remarkably functional. The layout isn't overwhelming, making it easy for visitors to
            locate
            what they need. The top navigation bar facilitates seamless movement across the website, while the prominent
            "Weekly Blogs" title in the center draws attention to the latest posts. Beneath it, the neatly listed blog
            entries maintain clarity and organization, ensuring users can easily find the content they're looking for.

        <p>
            While experimenting with a more modern or "digital" aesthetic for this design iteration, I find myself torn
            between the allure of visual captivation and the comfort of familiarity. Although visually captivating, I
            find
            myself gravitating back towards the simplicity of the first design. There's an undeniable allure to the
            sleekness of this new approach, yet something about the familiarity of the original design resonates with
            me.

        <p>
            Inspired by the simplicity of the initial blog index design, I sought to replicate its effectiveness for the
            essays page. While I aimed to differentiate the two, upon reflection, I realize that consistency throughout
            the
            website could enhance the overall user experience. Perhaps incorporating similar elements from the blog
            index
            design would create a cohesive browsing experience across different sections of the website, enhancing user
            engagement and navigation.

            My current portfolio page design appeals to me, but I have reservations about its future appearance once I
            start
            adding screenshots of my game. The potential for drastic contrasts between elements concerns me, as it may
            disrupt the overall aesthetic I've cultivated. Despite this uncertainty, I appreciate the overall design and
            layout of the page, finding it visually appealing and functional.
