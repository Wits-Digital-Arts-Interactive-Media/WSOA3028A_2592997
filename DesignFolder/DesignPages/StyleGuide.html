    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <p>In crafting my website's design, I embarked on a deliberate exploration of colour, layout, font, and other
        pivotal design elements, each chosen with careful consideration to evoke a cohesive and engaging user
        experience. One of the most decisions I made was to adopt a grayscale colour palette, an intentional choice
        aimed at fostering a sense of sophistication, neutrality, and versatility throughout the website. This grayscale
        foundation provides a timeless backdrop that allows other design elements to shine while ensuring a cohesive
        visual identity across different sections.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the selection of the Oswald font was a strategic move, chosen for its bold and modern aesthetic.
        Oswald's clean lines and geometric shapes complement the grayscale palette beautifully, adding a touch of
        contemporary flair without overpowering the overall design. Its readability and versatility make it an ideal
        choice for conveying essential information while maintaining visual interest.</p>

    <p>In terms of layout, I opted for a minimalist approach, prioritizing simplicity and clarity to guide users
        seamlessly through the website. Each design element was placed to enhance user flow and facilitate intuitive
        navigation. The decision to centre-align key components, such as titles and navigation menus, was a deliberate
        choice aimed at creating visual balance and drawing attention to essential content.</p>
    Furthermore, the incorporation of ample whitespace was a fundamental aspect of the design, serving to enhance
    readability, reduce visual clutter, and create a sense of elegance and sophistication. This strategic use of
    whitespace not only improves user comprehension but also contributes to a more visually pleasing browsing
    experience.

    <p>Overall, every design decision was made with the user in mind, with each element serving a purpose in enhancing
        usability, aesthetics, and overall user engagement. By carefully considering the interplay between colour,
        layout, font, and whitespace, I've crafted a cohesive and impactful design that reflects the essence of my brand
        while providing an immersive and enjoyable browsing experience for visitors.
