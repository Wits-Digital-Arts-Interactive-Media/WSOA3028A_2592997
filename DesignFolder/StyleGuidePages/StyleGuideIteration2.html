    <h2 class="centralText">Style Guide</h2>

    <p>
        In crafting my website's design, I embarked on a deliberate exploration of colour, layout, font, and other
        pivotal design elements, each chosen with careful consideration to evoke a cohesive and engaging user
        experience. One of the most decisions I made was to adopt a grayscale colour palette, an intentional choice
        aimed at fostering a sense of sophistication, neutrality, and versatility throughout the website. This
        grayscale
        foundation provides a timeless backdrop that allows other design elements to shine while ensuring a cohesive
        visual identity across different sections.
    </p>


    <p>
        Moreover, I haven't implemented this yet but the selection of the Oswald font was a strategic move, chosen
        for its bold and modern aesthetic.
        Oswald's clean lines and geometric shapes complement the grayscale palette beautifully, adding a touch of
        contemporary flair without overpowering the overall design. Its readability and versatility make it an ideal
        choice for conveying essential information while maintaining visual interest.
    </p>


    <p>
        In terms of layout, I opted for a minimalist approach, prioritizing simplicity and clarity to guide users
        seamlessly through the website. Each design element was placed to enhance user flow and facilitate intuitive
        navigation. The decision to centre-align key components, such as titles and navigation menus, was a
        deliberate
        choice aimed at creating visual balance and drawing attention to essential content.
    </p>


    <p>
        Furthermore, the incorporation of ample whitespace was a fundamental aspect of the design, serving to
        enhance
        readability, reduce visual clutter, and create a sense of elegance and sophistication. This strategic use of
        whitespace not only improves user comprehension but also contributes to a more visually pleasing browsing
        experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also want to ensure that the responsiveness of my website across various devices and screen sizes is
        paramount. I began looking at different ways to do this which lead me to learning about responsive design
        techniques, such as fluid grids and flexible images, to guarantee an optimal viewing experience for all
        users, regardless of the device they use to access my site.
    </p>


    <p>
        Overall, every design decision was made with the user in mind, with each element serving a purpose in
        enhancing
        usability, aesthetics, and overall user engagement. By carefully considering the interplay between colour,
        layout, font, and whitespace, I've crafted a cohesive and impactful design that reflects the essence of my
        brand
        while providing an immersive and enjoyable browsing experience for visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">Typography</h2>
    The Poppins font was chosen for its clean, modern look and high readability. This font is used consistently
    throughout the website to maintain a cohesive visual identity.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">Color Scheme</h2>
    A limited color palette was selected to create a unified and harmonious design. The colors were chosen to align with
    the website's message and goals, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
    
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">Imagery and Icons</h2>
    High-quality, relevant images and simple, recognizable icons are used to support the content and enhance the user
    experience. These visual elements are carefully selected to avoid clutter and ensure a clear visual hierarchy.
    Layout and Grid
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">White Space</h2>
    A consistent grid and layout structure are used to create order and balance on each page. This helps to guide the
    user's attention and create a sense of unity throughout the website.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h2 class="centralText">Visual Hierarchy</h2>
    Ample white space is used to create breathing room and focus, making it easier for users to navigate and engage with
    the content. A clear visual hierarchy is established through the use of size, color, and placement to direct the user's attention
    to the most important elements on each page.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        These visual design elements work together to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly design that effectively
        communicates the website's message and supports its goals.
