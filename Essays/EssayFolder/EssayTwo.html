    <h1>Essay 2: Digital Colonialism</h1>

    <p>
        The recent decision by Google to lay off a significant portion of its workforce from its "Core" teams and
        relocate roles to countries like India and Mexico is exemplary of a broader phenomenon known as digital
        colonialism. Digital colonialism refers to the exploitation of less economically developed regions by powerful
        tech corporations from more developed countries. This paradigm affects local economies, labour markets, and
        technological ecosystems in a lot of ways, particularly for developers like me who live in regions such as South
        Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
        Google's move to shift roles to lower-cost locations highlights a core principle of digital colonialism. But for
        South African developers, this trend presents both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, there may be
        increased opportunities for employment as global companies seek cost-efficient talent. On the other hand, the
        volatility of such job markets can lead to job insecurity and underemployment. Companies may prioritize cost
        savings over the stability and growth of local workforces, leading to a cyclical pattern of hiring and layoffs
        that destabilizes local economies. As Michael Kwet argues, "The national e-education initiative is a primary
        vessel for Silicon Valley corporations to capture South African education, economy, and society" (Kwet, M.2019),
        suggesting that the pursuit of cost savings by global tech firms can lead to a form of digital colonialism that
        undermines local development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another significant impact of digital colonialism is the phenomenon of talent drain, where skilled developers in
        South Africa might find themselves compelled to work for foreign companies due to the allure of higher wages and
        better working conditions. While this can lead to individual economic advancement, it often results in a brain
        drain, where the local tech ecosystem suffers from a lack of skilled professionals. This outflow of talent can
        oppose the growth of local tech industries and innovation.
    </p>

    <h3>Digital colonialism using Amrute’s article as a framework.</h3>

    <p>
        Digital colonialism, as discussed by Sareeta Amrute in her article "Tech Colonialism Today," refers to the ways
        in which technology and technological systems achieve and reinforce colonial relationships and power structures.
        This concept is rooted in the historical context of colonialism, where European powers exploited and controlled
        non-European territories, cultures, and peoples for economic and political gain. Amrute argues that these
        colonial dynamics continue to shape the development and deployment of digital technologies today.
    </p>

    <p>
        Amrute identifies several key characteristics of digital colonialism with the first being the Hierarchical
        Structure. Hierarchical Structure is where powerful corporations and governments control the development and
        deployment of technologies, while marginalized communities are relegated to secondary roles. As Madhavi
        Mallapragada notes, "the dominant narratives of innovation and progress are often shaped by the interests and
        values of powerful corporations and governments, while marginalized communities are relegated to secondary
        roles”. This hierarchy is reinforced by the ideology of techno-chauvinism, which assumes that a small group of
        people in Silicon Valley are best equipped to manage and control technological systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another characteristic of digital colonialism is the extraction and exploitation of resources, including data,
        minerals, and biological knowledge. This extraction is often done without the consent or benefit of the
        communities from which these resources are taken.
    </p>

    <p>
        The third characteristic of digital colonialism is Uneven Consequences. The consequences of digital colonialism
        are felt unevenly, with marginalized communities often bearing the brunt of the negative impacts.
    </p>

    <p>
        The fourth and final characteristic put forward by Armute is Malevolent Paternalism. Digital colonialism is also
        marked by malevolent paternalism, where solutions are presented as being for the benefit of marginalized
        communities but are designed and controlled by those in power. This paternalism is exemplified by the
        development of technologies that are marketed as solutions to social problems but are designed to reinforce
        existing power structures.
    </p>

    <p>
        With Armutes characteristics in mind, I done some research and investigated examples of digital colonialism. A
        noticeable example where a tech giant's actions have benefited them while potentially hindering marginalized
        communities is Facebook's deployment of the Free Basics service. Launched under the mask of bringing free
        internet access to developing countries, Free Basics provided users with access to a limited set of websites,
        with Facebook prominently included. This initiative expanded Facebook's user base in untapped markets, driving
        long-term growth in their advertising revenue and strengthening user loyalty. However, for the communities it
        claimed to help, Free Basics created a "walled garden" that restricted their internet experience to a curated
        selection of sites, effectively limiting their access to the full spectrum of information and services available
        online.
    </p>

    <p>
        The controversy surrounding Free Basics, especially in African countries, highlights the broader issue of net
        neutrality, as critics argued that the service violated the principle by favouring certain websites over others.
        "The content does not include some of the important websites that Ghanaians want to look at," (Solon, O. 2017)
        said Kofi Yeboah, who researched the app in Ghana, noting the absence of popular news websites such as
        MyJoyOnline and CityFM. This not only stifled local innovation but also disadvantaged smaller, independent
        content providers who couldn't afford to be part of Facebook's platform. Ultimately, this example underscores
        how the hierarchical control exerted by tech giants, can result in initiatives that prioritize corporate
        interests at the expense of equitable access and fairness for marginalized communities.
    </p>

    <h3>Relate it to the labour situation in global software development</h3>

    <p>
        The labour situation is a critical aspect of digital colonization in the software development industry. Western
        tech corporations often exploit workers in the Global South, employing them in low-wage, precarious conditions
        to support their operations. These workers are typically engaged in tasks such as data entry, content
        moderation, and software testing, which are essential for the functioning of AI systems and digital platforms.
        As Mark Graham and Jamie Woodcock note, "The digital economy is built on the backs of workers in the Global
        South who are engaged in precarious and low-wage work, often in conditions that are exploitative and violate
        basic human rights" (Graham & Woodcock, 2019).
    </p>

    <p>
        The exploitation of these workers perpetuates economic and social inequalities, as they are paid significantly
        less than their counterparts in the Global North and lack access to basic labour rights and protections. This
        situation is impaired by the lack of strong labour unions and the absence of effective labour laws in many
        countries in the Global South. The corporations further maintain their dominance by controlling the means of
        production, such as proprietary software and cloud infrastructure, and by extracting valuable data from users
        without providing adequate compensation or benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
        I conducted some research to look for specific case studies that can back up my statements, and I found that
        content moderators in India are often employed by major tech companies like Google and Microsoft to manage the
        content on their platforms. These workers are responsible for identifying and removing harmful content, such as
        hate speech and violent images, to ensure a safe and respectful online environment. However, despite their
        crucial role in maintaining the integrity of these platforms, content moderators in India are often paid very
        low wages. Many of them earn as little as $2 per hour, which is significantly lower than the wages of their
        counterparts in the Global North hindering not only the integrity of the market but the local economy as well.
        As the International Labour Organization notes, "Low pay and wage inequality remain a serious challenge to
        India's path to achieving decent working conditions and inclusive economic growth" (International Labour
        Organization, 2011)
    </p>

    <p>
        The low wages and lack of benefits for content moderators in India are a result of the exploitative labour
        practices employed by these tech companies. These companies often outsource their content moderation tasks to
        third-party contractors, who then hire workers in India and other countries in the Global South. This
        outsourcing allows the tech companies to avoid direct responsibility for the working conditions and wages of
        their content moderators, while still reaping the benefits of their labour. As a result, content moderators in
        India are often forced to work long hours in poor working conditions, with limited job security and few
        opportunities for advancement.
    </p>

    <h3>Relate that to the South African software development industry</h3>

    <p>
        In recent years, South Africa has witnessed a concerning trend of talented software developers choosing to
        pursue job opportunities abroad rather than staying within the country. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as
        "brain drain," poses significant challenges to the growth and competitiveness of the local tech industry.
        Emigration trends from South Africa have been on the rise, with skilled professionals, including software
        developers, opting for opportunities in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, New York, or London. Perceived better
        career prospects, higher salaries, and more opportunities for advancement abroad have fuelled this trend,
        drawing developers away from the local job market.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, the allure of a higher quality of life, better infrastructure, and more favourable work-life balance
        policies in foreign countries also contributes to the decision of South African developers to relocate. Working
        for international tech companies or startups offers exposure to cutting-edge technologies, diverse projects, and
        collaborative work environments, enhancing their skills and professional development. This exposure makes them
        more competitive in the global job market, further incentivizing them to seek opportunities abroad.
        Consequently, the emigration of skilled software developers exacerbates talent shortages in the South African
        tech industry, hindering innovation, and economic growth. As Indiran Govender puts it, “Brain drain and the loss
        of skilled professionals are a major reason for the unsteady growth of the South African economy”. (Govender, I.
        2024).
    </p>

    <p>
        Along with the loss of skilled workers, and the effect on the economy of the country, the presence of
        multinational tech giants in the South African labour market can overshadow local startups and innovation. These
        companies often have vast resources that dwarf those of local competitors, making it difficult for smaller
        entities to thrive. Furthermore, the focus on aligning with global standards and practices set by these
        companies can stifle local creativity and innovation, as developers may be more inclined to adopt established
        methods rather than innovate independently.
    </p>

    <h3>My understanding of my place in the sector and my role in decoloniality</h3>

    <p>
        As a South African in the tech sector, I understand that I am part of a complex web of power dynamics and
        colonial relationships that shape the development and deployment of digital technologies. I recognize that the
        tech industry, including global software development, is characterized by a hierarchical structure where
        powerful corporations and governments control the development and deployment of technologies, while marginalized
        communities are relegated to secondary roles.
    </p>

    <p>
        I acknowledge that the labour situation in global software development is marked by extraction and exploitation,
        where workers in peripheral communities, including South Africa, face different working conditions, lower wages,
        and fewer benefits compared to those in more developed regions. I also recognize that the consequences of
        digital colonialism are felt unevenly, with marginalized communities often bearing the brunt of the negative
        impacts.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a South African, I understand that I am part of a community that has been historically marginalized and
        exploited by colonial powers. I recognize that the legacy of colonialism continues to shape the power structures
        and relationships in the tech industry, and that it is essential to challenge and decolonize these
        relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of my role in decoloniality, I believe that I can play a crucial role in challenging the colonial
        dynamics that spread inequalities and marginalization. Especially after reading Sareeta Armute’s piece, I
        believe I can do this by:
    <ul>
        <li>Engaging with movements and initiatives that aim to challenge and decolonize the tech industry and support
            efforts to promote social justice and equity.</li>
        <li>Refusing to participate in colonial relationships and power structures, and instead work towards creating
            more equitable and just technological systems.</li>
        <li>Working towards creating a more inclusive and diverse tech industry and support the development of
            technologies that benefit marginalized communities.</li>
        <li>Considering the broader implications of my work and the impact it may have on marginalized communities,
            and work towards creating technologies that are more equitable and just.</li>
        <li>Using my skills and expertise to create technologies that are more inclusive and equitable, and work
            towards creating a more just and equitable tech industry.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        By playing this role, I believe that I can contribute to the decolonization of the tech industry and promote
        more equitable and just technological systems. "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards
        justice." - Martin Luther King Jr.
