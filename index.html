The instructions were clear, and the demonstrations were helpful in grasping the basics of creating a GitHub repository and deploying HTML projects to Pages. Following the step-by-step guidance, I managed to navigate through the setup process with relative ease. However, I do acknowledge the importance of staying proactive in my learning journey which is ironic because im doing this blog post by two weeks late.</p>
