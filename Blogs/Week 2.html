    <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
    For the folder structure of my website, I've opted for a setup that aligns with the different sections and functionalities I want to include. Currently, it looks something like this:
    <nav>
        <br>
        <li>Blog folder: This folder will contain HTML files for my weekly blog posts, ensuring a tidy structure and easy access.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Images: This folder is dedicated to storing all the images needed for the website, keeping them organized and readily available.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Portfolio: In this folder, I'll store all the HTML files related to my portfolio, showcasing my projects and work.</li>
        <br>
        <li>About me: In this folder I will brag about myself in the humblest way possible.</li>
        <br>
        <li>index.html or a homepage: The homepage will provide a brief overview of each section of the website and offer links to direct users to the desired information.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Essays: This page will hold our future essay projects</li>
    </nav>

    <br>
    <h3>URL Scheme</h3>
    <p>For my website, I've decided to stick with the HTTP scheme. While HTTPS offers encryption and enhanced security, my website doesn't handle any private or sensitive information at the moment. By using the HTTP scheme, I aim to maintain simplicity and accessibility for visitors without compromising on security where it's not necessary.</p>

    <h3>Reflect on Moulthrop, S. (2003) 'You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media(1991)' </h3>
    <p>The reading talks about how hypertext, which is basically non-linear writing where you can click on links to go to different parts of a text, changes the way we tell stories. It's like a "choose your own adventure" book but on a computer. He thinks it's cool because it lets readers be more involved in making sense of the story. This idea of letting readers interact with the text is kind of like what we do on the internet today. When you're surfing the web, you're not just passively reading stuff, you're clicking links, watching videos, and jumping around different websites.</p>
   
    <p>Hypertext and the Laws of Media also talks about hypertext but in a more formal way. It uses this thing called the "Laws of Media" to look at how hypertext changes the way we communicate and think. Basically, it says hypertext makes it easier to find information, changes how we read and write, and brings back some old ways of communicating like storytelling. These ideas are pretty relevant today because the internet is full of links, videos, and interactive stuff. It's not just about reading anymore, it's about exploring and interacting with content in different ways.</p>
    
    <p>So, both readings are saying that hypertext, which is all about non-linear storytelling and interactive content, is a big deal. It's not just changing how we tell stories, but also how we communicate and learn on the internet today.</p>
   
    
    <h3>Reflect on interaction and the www: what does interaction mean to you?</h3>
    <p>The defination that I was able to come up with is that interaction is the exchange of actions and responses between users and the digital interface. Interaction with the World Wide Web has completely changed the way we do things online. Back then, clicking on links was the main action. Now, it's way more than that. Think about how you scroll through social media feeds endlessly or use your voice to search for something on your phone. That's all part of web interaction. And it's not just about what you do,	 it's how the web reacts to you. Websites and apps have gotten super smart, giving you instant feedback and adapting to what you need in real-time. Plus, the web has brought people together like never before. Social media, online communities, and collaboration tools make it easy to connect with others, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
