    <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
    For the folder structure of my website, I've opted for a setup that aligns with the different sections and functionalities I want to include. Currently, it looks something like this:
    <nav>
        <br>
        <li>Blog folder: This folder will contain HTML files for my weekly blog posts, ensuring a tidy structure and easy access.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Images: This folder is dedicated to storing all the images needed for the website, keeping them organized and readily available.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Portfolio: In this folder, I'll store all the HTML files related to my portfolio, showcasing my projects and work.</li>
        <br>
        <li>About me: In this folder I will brag about myself in the humblest way possible.</li>
        <br>
        <li>index.html or a homepage: The homepage will provide a brief overview of each section of the website and offer links to direct users to the desired information.</li>
    </nav>
