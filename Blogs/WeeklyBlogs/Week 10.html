    <h2> Close reading of Robinson et al. - 2015 - Digital inequalities and why they matter</h2>


    <p>
        In the digital age, access to technology and the internet has become increasingly vital for various aspects
        of life,
        including education, healthcare, employment, and social connections. However, not everyone has equal
        opportunities
        to benefit from these digital resources, leading to what is known as digital inequalities. The article
        "Digital
        Inequalities and Why They Matter" sheds light on the significance of understanding and addressing these
        disparities
        to ensure a more equitable society.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the key points highlighted in the article is the impact of digital inequalities on individuals with
        limited
        internet access or skills. For example, the design flaws of websites like Healthcare.gov made it challenging
        for
        people with smaller screens or portable devices to navigate effectively, leading to low enrolment rates
        among
        certain groups. This underscores the importance of considering diverse user needs and capabilities when
        designing digital platforms to ensure inclusivity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, digital inequalities are not just limited to access issues but also extend to disparities in the
        adoption
        and use of eHealth systems based on social status differences. Research suggests that certain groups may
        face
        barriers in utilizing digital health tools effectively, which can further exacerbate existing health
        disparities.
        Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing interventions and strategies that can bridge the gap
        and
        improve health outcomes for all individuals.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        The article also emphasizes the global perspective of digital inequalities, highlighting how economic
        divisions
        between regions can reinforce racial and ethnic disparities in internet access. For instance, while a
        significant portion of the world's population resides in Africa, only a small percentage have access to the
        internet, reflecting broader issues of marginalization and exclusion. This underscores the need for a more
        inclusive
        approach to digital development that considers the diverse needs and contexts of different populations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To address digital inequalities effectively, the article suggests exploring various research avenues, such
        as
        examining the long-term effects of eHealth use on health outcomes and leveraging mobile devices to bridge
        gaps for
        disadvantaged groups. Additionally, understanding the role of social media in reducing network homophily and
        increasing social capital among minorities can offer valuable insights into leveraging technology for social
        inclusion.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        In conclusion, digital inequalities pose significant challenges in today's society, impacting access to
        information,
        opportunities, and essential services for marginalized populations. By recognizing the complexities of these
        disparities and actively working towards more inclusive digital strategies, we can strive towards a more
        equitable
        and accessible digital landscape for all individuals. Research, policy interventions, and collaborative
        efforts
        across sectors are essential in addressing digital inequalities and creating a more inclusive digital
        society.

        Weekly Reflection
    </h2>

    <p>
        Throughout this week, I found myself deeply engrossed in the intricacies of backend development. The process
        of working on server-side scripting and integrating databases into the website brought a sense of
        fulfillment as I witnessed the tangible impact of data manipulation and server interactions on enhancing the
        website's functionality. However, amidst the excitement of exploration, I encountered a notable challenge.
        Debugging server-side code and troubleshooting database connectivity issues proved to be formidable tasks
        that tested both my patience and problem-solving abilities. Navigating through server errors and mastering
        debugging techniques demanded persistence and a willingness to delve into the underlying mechanisms of the
        system. Despite these challenges, I successfully addressed last week's hurdles through a combination of
        perseverance and resourcefulness. By utilizing the debugging tools provided by the server environment and
        meticulously reviewing error logs, I was able to pinpoint the root causes of issues. Additionally, seeking
        advice from experienced developers and consulting online resources provided valuable insights and effective
        solutions. Reflecting on these experiences, I acknowledge the complexity inherent in backend development and
        recognize the importance of continuously refining my skills in server-side scripting and database
        management. Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, I am confident in my ability to tackle future
        backend development tasks with increased proficiency and assurance.
