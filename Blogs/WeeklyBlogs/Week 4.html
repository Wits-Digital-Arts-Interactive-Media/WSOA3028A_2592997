    <h3>Work through the IxD Process and begin noting your thoughts</h3>  
        <h4><u>Goal allignment</u></h4>  
        <p>I intend for my website to serve as my portfolio, impressing potential employers with my skills. Every aspect of my website is geared towards supporting this overarching goal. Unfortunately, we still have not learned how to make use of CSS, so my website still looks super boring. From the design and layout to the content and functionality, when this website is done, everything should work together to showcase my work effectively. I've made sure that visitors can easily navigate my portfolio, view my projects, and understand the value I bring to the table. </p>

        <h4><u>Target Audience</u></h4>  
        <p>My target audience consists of potential employers or recruiters who are interested in evaluating my skills and experience. They visit my website with the specific goal of assessing my suitability for job opportunities. I've tailored my website's content and design to resonate with this audience, considering what information and features would be most relevant and valuable to them when evaluating my portfolio. Honestly speaking I am answering these questions based on what I would like my final website to look like not what I currently have. As of right now other than Hanli I don't really have a target audience.</p>    

        <h4><u>Content</u></h4>  
        <p>The content of my website primarily focuses on showcasing my portfolio projects. I plan to highlight my best work and provided information about each project and the outcomes achieved. I've also included additional content that reinforces my skills and expertise, such as a bio or about me section. Right now, it's just random facts about myself but I would like it to hold testimonials or endorsements from future clients, and or any relevant certifications or awards. By providing comprehensive and compelling content, I should be able to effectively communicate my capabilities and stand out to potential employers.</p>


    <h3>Reflect on your work for website 1</h3>
    <p>Designing this website was a tremendous relief for me. Initially, I approached this course with some apprehension, fearing the complexity it might entail. Surprisingly, learning HTML turned out to be one of the easiest skills I've acquired in my digital arts career. While not necessarily a challenge, I did find myself growing somewhat frustrated with the extensive writing and reading requirements. However, I understand that these tasks are ultimately for my own benefit, so I can't really complain. Looking ahead, one aspect I'd like to improve upon is the implementation of CSS to enhance the visual appeal of my website.</p>
