        How code matters in decolonialism
    </h3>
    <p>
        When thinking about how our code matters in the context of decolonialism, I've identified several aspects of my own
        coding practice that I plan to incorporate. As someone who aims to design websites for a global audience, I recognize
        the importance of prioritizing mobile-first design, especially in regions like Africa where the majority of users
        access the internet through mobile devices. This means ensuring that my applications are optimized for smaller
        screens, slower internet speeds, and limited data plans, while also considering the specific challenges of mobile
        networks in these areas, such as high latency and limited bandwidth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another important aspect is language and accessibility. Decolonialism emphasizes the need to center marginalized
        voices and perspectives, which in coding terms means being mindful of the languages I use and the accessibility of
        my applications. I should consider developing applications that support local languages and dialects, making them
        more accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, I should ensure that my applications are accessible to people
        with disabilities, following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and other accessibility standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data storage and ownership is another area where I need to be mindful. Decolonialism critiques the exploitation of
        resources, including data, by colonial powers. As a coder, I should prioritize data privacy, security, and
        transparency, ensuring that users have control over their data and are aware of how it is being used. This includes
        using secure protocols for data transmission, encrypting sensitive information, and providing users with clear
        options for data deletion and management.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cultural sensitivity and representation are also crucial considerations. My code should be culturally sensitive and
        representative of the diverse communities I serve. This means avoiding cultural appropriation, stereotypes, and
        biases in my applications. I should use inclusive language, avoid culturally insensitive imagery, and ensure that my
        applications are free from biases in their algorithms and decision-making processes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Collaboration and community engagement are also important aspects of decolonial coding practice. I should work
        closely with local communities, involving them in the development process and prioritizing their needs and
        perspectives. This includes engaging in participatory design, where users are actively involved in the design and
        development of applications, and providing opportunities for community members to contribute to the development
        process.

        Reflection on development process
    </h3>
    <p>
        This week, or rather this entire submission, marks a pivotal shift in my approach. I've transcended mere
        compliance
        to actually manifesting the visions I've meticulously outlined in my wireframes and style guide. It all
        commenced
        with the index page, envisaged as a gateway adorned with four inviting cards or "big buttons," beckoning users
        to
        explore the essence of my website.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, I adorned these cards with CSS, crafting them into visual marvels. Yet, I encountered a profound
        epiphany
        – CSS, while masterful in its domain of aesthetics, is impotent when it comes to imbuing elements with
        functionality. This realization served as my induction into the nuanced realm of web languages. CSS, a virtuoso
        in
        styling and embellishment, wields no influence over functionality. Enter JavaScript, the orchestrator of
        interaction
        and data manipulation, breathing life into static designs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Armed with newfound knowledge, I embarked on a journey to infuse functionality into my creation. JavaScript
        became
        my beacon, guiding me through the labyrinth of event-driven programming. I discovered the power of events –
        subtle
        triggers that enable systems to discern user actions, from hovering to clicking and beyond. Leveraging the 'on
        click' event, I choreographed the symphony of interaction, directing each click to unveil the corresponding
        card's
        realm.
    </p>

    <p>
        Responsive design stands as both a beacon of innovation and a crucible of challenges in the digital landscape.
        At
        its core, responsive design champions inclusivity, ensuring seamless user experiences across an ever-expanding
        array
        of devices. This adaptability empowers users to engage with content unhindered, irrespective of screen size or
        device orientation.

    </p>

    <p>
        Yet, amid its virtues, responsive design poses formidable challenges. The quest for universality demands
        meticulous
        planning and execution. Crafting layouts that gracefully adapt to diverse screen dimensions necessitates a
        delicate
        balance between design aesthetics and technical feasibility. Achieving this equilibrium demands a keen
        understanding
        of fluid grid systems, flexible images, and media queries.
    </p>

    <p>
        In essence, responsive design is a double-edged sword – a testament to the boundless possibilities of digital
        innovation, yet a crucible wherein designers are forged by the fires of adaptability and resilience.
