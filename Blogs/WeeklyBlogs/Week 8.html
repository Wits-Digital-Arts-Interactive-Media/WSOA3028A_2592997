            Technologies developed for the 'centre' disproportionately impact the 'margins'. This phenomenon becomes even more
            pronounced when these technologies are created, tested, and implemented by predominantly white men from the US. The
            question then arises: what happens to everyone else?

            When tech development is centralized around a specific demographic, particularly white men from the US, it
            inherently carries their biases, perspectives, and experiences. This consistency in the tech industry leads to a
            lack of diversity in thought, resulting in products and systems that may not adequately cater to the needs and
            realities of diverse populations worldwide. As a consequence, marginalized communities, including women, people of
            colour, and individuals from different cultural backgrounds, face the brunt of these technological innovations.

            One of the primary issues stemming from this imbalance is the perpetuation of societal inequalities and biases.
            Algorithms and AI systems, for example, often reflect the biases of their creators, leading to discriminatory
            outcomes in areas such as hiring practices, predictive policing, healthcare, and more. These technologies, when
            deployed without considering the diverse perspectives and experiences of marginalized groups, can exacerbate
            existing disparities and further marginalize those already at the fringes of society.

            Moreover, the lack of representation in tech development not only limits the scope of innovation but also hinders
            the potential for inclusive and equitable solutions. By excluding diverse voices from the creation and
            implementation of technology, we miss out on valuable insights, alternative viewpoints, and unique problem-solving
            approaches that could address the complex challenges faced by different communities.

            To address these issues, it is imperative to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the tech industry. By
            fostering a more inclusive environment that values and amplifies diverse voices, we can ensure that technological
            advancements benefit all members of society, not just a privileged few. Encouraging collaboration across different
            backgrounds, cultures, and experiences can lead to the development of more ethical, inclusive, and socially
            responsible technologies that uplift and empower marginalized communities.

            In conclusion, the impact of technologies developed by the 'centre' on the 'margins' underscores the urgent need for
            a more inclusive and diverse approach to tech development. By recognizing and addressing the biases inherent in
            current tech practices, we can pave the way for a more equitable and just technological landscape that benefits
            everyone, regardless of their background or identity.
