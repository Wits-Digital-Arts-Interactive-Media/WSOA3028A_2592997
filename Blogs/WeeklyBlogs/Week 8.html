        <p>
            Technologies developed for the 'centre' disproportionately impact the 'margins'. This phenomenon becomes
            even more
            pronounced when these technologies are created, tested, and implemented by predominantly white men from the
            US. The
            question then arises: what happens to everyone else?
        </p>



        <p>
            When tech development is centralized around a specific demographic, particularly white men from the US, it
            inherently carries their biases, perspectives, and experiences. This consistency in the tech industry leads
            to a
            lack of diversity in thought, resulting in products and systems that may not adequately cater to the needs
            and
            realities of diverse populations worldwide. As a consequence, marginalized communities, including women,
            people of
            colour, and individuals from different cultural backgrounds, face the brunt of these technological
            innovations.
        </p>



        <p>
            One of the primary issues stemming from this imbalance is the perpetuation of societal inequalities and
            biases.
            Algorithms and AI systems, for example, often reflect the biases of their creators, leading to
            discriminatory
            outcomes in areas such as hiring practices, predictive policing, healthcare, and more. These technologies,
            when
            deployed without considering the diverse perspectives and experiences of marginalized groups, can exacerbate
            existing disparities and further marginalize those already at the fringes of society.
        </p>



        <p>
            Moreover, the lack of representation in tech development not only limits the scope of innovation but also
            hinders
            the potential for inclusive and equitable solutions. By excluding diverse voices from the creation and
            implementation of technology, we miss out on valuable insights, alternative viewpoints, and unique
            problem-solving
            approaches that could address the complex challenges faced by different communities.
        </p>
  


        <p>
            To address these issues, it is imperative to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the tech industry.
            By
            fostering a more inclusive environment that values and amplifies diverse voices, we can ensure that
            technological
            advancements benefit all members of society, not just a privileged few. Encouraging collaboration across
            different
            backgrounds, cultures, and experiences can lead to the development of more ethical, inclusive, and socially
            responsible technologies that uplift and empower marginalized communities.
        </p>



        <p>
            In conclusion, the impact of technologies developed by the 'centre' on the 'margins' underscores the urgent
            need for
            a more inclusive and diverse approach to tech development. By recognizing and addressing the biases inherent
            in
            current tech practices, we can pave the way for a more equitable and just technological landscape that
            benefits
            everyone, regardless of their background or identity.
        </p>

            Weekly Reflection
        </h2>
        <p>
            Throughout this week, I've come to appreciate the profound importance of UI wireframes in the web
            development process. Previously, I might have considered them as optional or merely a preliminary step, but
            now I realize their crucial role in shaping the user experience and guiding development. These wireframes
            serve as blueprints for the entire project, providing a visual representation of the layout, structure, and
            functionality of the website. They enable stakeholders to visualize the final product early on, allowing for
            valuable feedback before significant time and resources are invested. Integrating UI wireframes into my
            workflow this week had a significant impact on my development process. With a clear roadmap of the website's
            design and functionality, I worked more efficiently, focusing efforts on implementing features and refining
            the user interface based on wireframe guidelines. This experience taught me that wireframes are not just
            design tools but communication tools, facilitating collaboration and alignment among project stakeholders.
            They ensure everyone shares a common vision and understanding of the final product, leading to a more
            cohesive and successful outcome. Moving forward, I plan to continue incorporating UI wireframes from the
            outset, streamlining development, reducing misunderstandings, and delivering websites that are visually
            appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly.
