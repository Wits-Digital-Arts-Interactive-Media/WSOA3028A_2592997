    <h3>Define and discuss user allignment</h3>    
        <p>User alignment the designing of a website with an understanding of its future actors. It starts with getting to know these people really well. So, figuring out who they are, what they like, and what they need from the product. </p>
        <p>I've learnt that this is done by making up fictional characters, called personas, to represent different types of actors and understand their viewpoints better. Throughout the design process, the focus stays on putting the users first. That means prioritizing features and making sure the design is easy to use and tailored to what actors want. </p>
        <p>For my website, the main goal is for it to be my portfolio, a showcase for potential employers to see what I can do. So, everything about the website needs to support that goal. From how it looks to what it says and does, it's all about making sure my work stands out and grabs attention. I want visitors to be able to easily find their way around, to see examples of my best projects, and to get a sense of what I bring to the table.</p>

        <h3>Interface elements</h3>
        <h5><u>Input Controls</u></h5>
        <nav>
            <li>Buttons: These could be used for calls-to-action, such as "View Portfolio" or "About Me".</li>
        </nav>

        <h5><u>Navigational components</u></h5>
        <nav>
            <li>Breadcrumb Navigation: This will help actors understand their current location within your website's hierarchy and easily navigate back to previous pages..</li>
            <li>Pagination: My website will have a lot of unrelated entities so I definitely plan on having multiple pages to rely this information on.</li>
        </nav>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>User alignment is key to how your website is organized, how its URLs are structured, and the way its content is marked up. Basically, it's about understanding who the audience is and what they want, then tailoring the website to meet those needs. This understanding helps decide how to arrange content in a way that makes sense to visitors and makes it easy for them to find what they're looking for. URLs should be descriptive and easy to read, giving users a clear idea of what each page is about. And when it comes to marking up content, using semantic HTML elements helps both users and search engines understand the structure and meaning of your pages. By aligning the website with what users want and need, we can create a site that's not only user-friendly but also effective in communicating my goals and engaging my visitors.</p>
