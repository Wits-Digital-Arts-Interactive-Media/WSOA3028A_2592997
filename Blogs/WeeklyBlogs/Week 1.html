    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <h3>Experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages</h3>
    <p>Learning how to set up GitHub and publish to Pages was a straightforward process with the guidance provided. The instructions were clear, and the demonstrations were helpful in grasping the basics of creating a GitHub repository and deploying HTML projects to Pages. Following the step-by-step guidance, I managed to navigate through the setup process with relative ease. However, I do acknowledge the importance of staying proactive in my learning journey which is ironic because im doing this blog post by two weeks late.</p>
    <p>HTML, with its many intricate features and nuances, demands consistent practice and attention to detail. Even the slightest misstep could potentially set me off track, hindering my progress and understanding of this foundational language of the web. Therefore, I'm committed to staying proactive, regularly revisiting concepts, and seeking additional resources or assistance when needed. By maintaining this proactive approach, I aim to deepen my understanding of HTML and ensure steady progress towards mastering this essential skill in web development.</p>
    
    <h3>As We May Think - Vannevar Bush 1945</h3>
    <p>Reflecting on Vannevar Bush's essay "As We May Think," it's pretty amazing how he saw the future of tech way back in 1945. He talked about this thing called the MEMEX that could totally change how we access information, kind of like what we do with the internet now.</p>
    <p>It's actually crazy how ahead of his time he was. And what's even crazier is that he has a background in nuclear research which adds this interesting twist to his ideas, showing how technology can be both a force for good and a bit scary at the same time. Overall, the reading makes you think about how far we've come with tech and how it's shaping our world today.</p>
    <p>I also find it pretty cool to see how his ideas from way back still make a lot of sense in how we use the internet today. He talked about how important it is for information systems to work the way our brains do, focusing on how we naturally connect ideas instead of forcing us into strict categories.</p>
    <p>We see this in how websites recommend stuff to you based on what you've looked at before. That's like what Bush was talking about with his idea of personalizing information based on our experiences. It's like having a friend who knows exactly what you like and suggests things you might be into.</p>

    <h3>Something I found interesting about the WWW</h3>
    <p>One really cool thing about the history of the World Wide Web the fact that it all started with a simple idea from Tim Berners-Lee. He came up with this idea of using hypertext to manage information within the organization. Basically, he wanted to create a network of connected documents that anyone could access from their computer.  And now from that small idea, we've got the internet as we know it today, changing the way we share and find information across the globe. It's pretty amazing how something so simple turned into something so big.</p>

    <h3>My goals for this course</h3>
    <p>In taking this interactive media course to learn web design, my primary goal is to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to create engaging and functional websites. I aim to understand the principles of design and user experience, learning how to effectively communicate ideas and messages through intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. Additionally, I hope to gain proficiency in using various tools and technologies essential for web development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ultimately, my objective is to become a versatile and proficient web designer capable of crafting immersive digital experiences that resonate with audiences.</p>
