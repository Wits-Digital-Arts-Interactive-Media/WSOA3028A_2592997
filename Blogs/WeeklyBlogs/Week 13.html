    <h3>
        Ethical Internet
    </h3>
    <p>
        To me, the internet as an ethical space means that the online world should be a place where we uphold and
        promote
        ethical principles and values. This includes ensuring that the internet is a safe, inclusive, and equitable
        environment for all users, where fundamental human rights and freedoms are respected and protected.
    </p>

    <p>
        In an ideal wordl, I would envision a space where all individuals are treated with respect, dignity, and
        without discrimination, regardless of their background, identity, or beliefs. Personal data and privacy are
        safeguarded, and users have control over how their information is collected, used, and shared. Individuals can
        freely express their thoughts and opinions, while also being mindful of the potential impact on others and the
        need
        to avoid harm or hate speech.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are clear and transparent processes in place to address issues, such as online harassment, misinformation,
        or
        abuse, with appropriate accountability measures for those who violate ethical standards. The internet is
        designed to
        be accessible and inclusive, catering to the diverse needs and abilities of all users, including those with
        disabilities or from marginalized communities.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, achieving this vision of an ethical internet is not without its challenges. Navigating the complex
        interplay between individual rights, such as freedom of expression, and the need to prevent harm or protect
        vulnerable groups can be challenging. The pace of technological change, with the emergence of new platforms,
        algorithms, and data-driven technologies, can outpace the development of ethical frameworks and governance
        structures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Establishing consistent ethical standards and enforcement mechanisms across different jurisdictions and cultural
        contexts can be a significant challenge, requiring global cooperation and coordination. The widespread
        dissemination
        of false or misleading information online can undermine trust, erode democratic processes, and pose serious
        ethical
        and societal challenges.

        Reflection on development process
    </h3>

    <p>
        This week, my focus was on refining the visual aspects of my website, particularly by adding an introductory
        animation. I aimed to create an engaging experience for users with text dynamically appearing on the screen,
        welcoming them to my website. However, I encountered a significant challenge stemming from my background in
        programming, particularly in Unity. Transitioning to web design revealed stark differences in how content is
        structured and accessed.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        In Unity, creating distinct scenes and transitioning between them is straightforward, but in web development, the
        paradigm is fundamentally different. The index page serves as the main entry point, which initially puzzled me. My
        initial approach involved creating a full-screen element that would simulate a separate page, gradually revealing
        its content upon user interaction. However, I soon realized that each page load triggered a reload of associated
        scripts, complicating my efforts to maintain the state of this element across page transitions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite these hurdles, I've embraced the learning opportunity this challenge presented. Delving deeper into web
        development, I've explored concepts such as local storage, cookies, and event listeners. These investigations have
        broadened my understanding of web technologies, even though implementing them remains a work in progress. Currently,
        I'm still fine-tuning the functionality, striving to achieve the desired outcome.
    </p>

        You as the marker will be able to see whether i've succeeded or failed. Click on the home in the navigation bar and hopefully it doesn't pop up again. If it does just act like that's supposed to happen
