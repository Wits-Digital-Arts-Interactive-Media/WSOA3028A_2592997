    <h2>Reflection on "Algorithmic Colonization of Africa"</h2>

    <p>
        I found Abeba Birhane's work on "Algorithmic Colonization of Africa" to be a thought-provoking and insightful
        analysis of the similarities between traditional colonialism and the current dominance of Western tech
        monopolies in
        Africa. As someone with a keen interest in the intersection of technology, society, and global power dynamics,
        this
        paper really resonated with me.
    </p>


    <p>
        Birhane's central argument that Western tech giants, driven by profit motives, are exploiting Africa in ways
        that
        mirror the colonial era is compelling. The examples she provides, such as the lack of relevance of many AI
        systems
        to African contexts and the stifling of local innovation, vividly illustrate her point. This aligns with other
        scholarly perspectives, such as that of (Crawford, 2021), who notes that AI often perpetuates existing
        inequalities
        and power imbalances, rather than alleviating them. I was particularly struck by her observation that this
        algorithmic invasion is simultaneously impoverishing local development while making Africa dependent on Western
        software and infrastructure (Birhane, 2020).
    </p>

    <p>
        What I found most valuable about this work is how it challenges us to think critically about the societal
        impacts of
        emerging technologies like AI. It would be easy to get caught up in the hype and promise of these tools, but
        Birhane
        reminds us that they are not neutral - they embody the values and interests of their creators. This is echoed by
        (Noble, 2018), who argues that technologies often reinforce the biases of their developers. If those values are
        misaligned with the needs of African communities, the results can be exploitative and harmful.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the same time, I appreciate that Birhane is not rejecting technology outright. She acknowledges the potential
        benefits that access to quality data and AI developments could bring to Africa. Her vision is of a more
        equitable,
        community-centred approach to technological development that empowers Africans rather than subjugating them.
        This
        call for a participatory and inclusive approach is crucial, as highlighted by (Eubanks, 2018), who advocates for
        technologies that serve the public good and are developed with community input.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately, I believe Birhane's work is an important contribution to the growing body of scholarship examining
        the
        sociopolitical implications of AI and other emerging technologies. Her concept of "algorithmic colonization"
        provides a powerful framework for understanding the dynamics at play and the urgent need for a more just and
        inclusive approach to technological progress.

    <h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>

    <p>
        This week, or rather this whole submission, I’ve decided to actually try and create what I have illustrated in
        my wireframes and style guide instead of simply creating what is required from me. So, I began with my index
        page where I planned to have 4 cards or “big buttons” that allowed the user to navigate to the main components
        of my website. I used a bit of CSS to design my cards, but I quickly found out that CSS scripts cannot be used
        to record or facilitate any interaction between the user and the website. This was a big realisation for me as
        this was the time I actually learnt the actual uses of the different languages. CSS is primarily used for
        styling and decoration however it has no effect on what the elements do functionality wise, and JavaScript is in
        charge of not only interaction but data manipulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        With that being said, I went on and made a JavaScript that controlled what the cards did once clicked on. I
        learnt that not only buttons but almost every element can be given these things called events that allow the
        system to recognize things like when the mouse is being hovered over an element, when its being clicked on and
        so many more. I used the on mouse click event to load the corresponding card’s page.
    </p>
