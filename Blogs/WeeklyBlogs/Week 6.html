            The website's navigation menu features a dropdown menu, which allows users to
            explore terms or terms they may not be familiar with. This feature is particularly useful for users who may
            not know the exact terminology or keywords to search for. Instead of relying solely on search queries that
            may not match with specific terms or concepts, users can browse through the dropdown menu to discover
            relevant information or resources. This enhances usability and ensures that users can easily access content
            even if they are unsure of the specific terminology.

            Cluttered sections: Some sections of the website, particularly those with a high volume of information or
            resources, may appear cluttered or overloaded. This can make it difficult for users to focus on specific
            content
            or navigate efficiently, especially on smaller screens.
            The design of the Eskom website also feels a little outdated compared to more modern websites. Although this
            shouldn’t be the main focus, I think that It could benefit from incorporating contemporary design trends and
            visual elements to enhance aesthetic appeal and engagement.

        <p>News24 website has a simple yet very effective user interface. The home page much like others has the
            expected
            navigation menu with recent headlines below. Playing to the user’s cognitive senses it displays the “main”
            headline significantly bigger than others. This headline generally holds the news that users are coming to
            find
            making the user experience a lot better.

            However, the News24 website may lack a clear visual hierarchy, making it difficult for
            users to distinguish between different types of content or prioritize information. Without clear visual cues
            such as headings, subheadings, or contrasting styles, users may struggle to navigate the website
            efficiently.

            Weekly Reflection
        </h2>
        <p>
            During Week 6 of my web development journey, I encountered significant struggles with implementing Java
            functionality into my project. Java's strict case sensitivity emerged as a major hurdle, leading to errors
            and inconsistencies throughout my code. Understanding the precise matching requirements of Java's case
            sensitivity proved challenging, as even minor variations in variable names, method calls, or class
            references could result in runtime errors or unexpected behavior. Despite my efforts to meticulously review
            my code and utilize debugging tools, resolving these issues required patience and persistence. Seeking
            assistance from online resources and Java documentation provided valuable insights into the language's case
            sensitivity rules and common pitfalls. Through this experience, I learned the importance of attention to
            detail and consistency in Java programming practices. Moving forward, I plan to adopt strategies such as
            employing meaningful variable names and adhering to consistent naming conventions to minimize the risk of
            case sensitivity errors in my Java code. Reflecting on these struggles has deepened my understanding of Java
            programming and reinforced the need for precision in my coding practices.
